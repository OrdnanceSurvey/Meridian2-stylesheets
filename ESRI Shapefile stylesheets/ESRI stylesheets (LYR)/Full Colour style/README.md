These are LYR files for Meridian 2 in ESRI Shapefile format for use in ESRI ArcGIS.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

**2.**  Open a new blank map in ArcMap

**3.**  Right-click on ‘Layers’ at the top of the Table Of Contents, select Properties… > then General > set the Label Engine to ‘Maplex Label Engine’

**4.**  In the same window select the Coordinate System tab > choose British National Grid

**5.**  To add a sea tint, navigate to the Frame tab and change the background colour to R228 G244 B247. Click OK

**6.**  Click on the ‘Add Data’ button and navigate to the stylesheets folder and the directory that matches your data format, stylesheet format and style preference

**9.**  Double-click on a layer to access the ‘Layer Properties’ window > select the ‘Source tab’ > click on ‘Set Data Source…’ > navigate to your Meridian 2 data > select the data that matches the layer, for example for settlemt_point = settlemt_point.shp > select ‘Add’

Repeat step 9 for all layers.

We recommend viewing the map between **1:20,000** and **1:75,000** for maximum legibility

Your map should now look similar to this:
