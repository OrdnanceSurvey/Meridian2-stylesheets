# Meridian 2 Backdrop style

These are QML files for Meridian 2 in ESRI Shapefile format for use in QGIS.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/Meridian2-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Copy all the QML stylesheets (those files ending .qml) into the same directory as your Meridian 2 ESRI Shapefile data

**3.**  Load your Meridian 2 data into QGIS and it should appear pre-styled

*Aternatively you can load each style individually through the 'Layer Properties' window within QGIS*

**4.**  To add a sea tint, navigate to 'Project' > 'Project Properties...' and change the background colour to **R**228 **G**244 **B**247

**5.**  Although every feature is styled, for use as a contextual map we recommend the following layer order and visibility:

We recommend viewing the map between **1:25,000** and **1:75,000** for maximum legibility.

Your map should now look similar to this:
